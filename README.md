# Federal-DoD-Software-Factory-Compliance
This repository is a collection of resources to help facilitate compliance innovation utilizing Cloud, DevSecOps and Software Factory technologies and implementations. 

## Background

There has been an increased push for to adopt Cloud, DevSecOps and Software Factories within the U.S. Federal and Department of Defense (DoD) enviroments. However, one of the largest impediments to these outcomes often is the incredibly cumbersome and bureaucratic compliance requirements in Federal environments. This repository will be a collection of resources that help facilitate compliance innovation which can lead to improved outcomes for U.S. Citizens, Warfighters and the nation as whole.

## Machine Readable Documentation

One of the most challenging aspects of Federal and DoD compliance initiaitives is documenting the various security controls, control implementation statements and associated documentation for Federal IT systems to go into production environments. The below resources will highlight some of the efforts underway to make traditionally static and detailed documentation into machine readable formats. The benefits of this is that compliance validation can be semi-automated, re-usable and streamlined. 

- The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL): NIST is developing the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) as a standardized, data-centric framework that can be applied to an information system for documenting and assessing its security controls. Today, security controls and control baselines are represented in proprietary formats, requiring data conversion and manual effort to describe their implementation. An important goal of OSCAL is to move the security controls and control baselines from a text-based and manual approach (using word processors or spreadsheets) to a set of standardized and machine-readable formats. With systems security information represented in OSCAL, security professionals will be able to automate security assessment, auditing, and continuous monitoring processes.
